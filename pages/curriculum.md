## Idea

Training in software and computing are essential ingredients for the success of any Research Software Engineering. As most research software development have similar basic prerequisites (Unix shell, Python, C++, â€¦) we want to join our efforts and create one introductory research software training curriculum that serves newcomers the software skills needed as they enter the field, and in parallel, instill best practices for writing software.

The curriculum is comprised of a set of standardized *modules*, so that students can focus on what is most relevant to them.

## The modules
