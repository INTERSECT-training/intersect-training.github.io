We have collected material (slides, videos, notebooks, etc) used for research software engineering training events from INTERSECT and existing materials found [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/training-links).
Contributions to the collection are welcomed.

We have curated, evaluated, and refined the list to use as a starting point for the [RSE workshops]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/workshops/).
The resulting open-source material is hosted online and shared with the community.
This curriculum serves as the basis for the [INTERSECT bootcamps]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/bootcamps/).

If you are currently involved in providing research software engineering training, or you have material you've found useful and would like to contribute, please see the instructions at the bottom of the page [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/training-links#contribute).
