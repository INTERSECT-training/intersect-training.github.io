RSEs are increasingly recruited to design and deliver software training programs to students and researchers.
RSEs are uniquely qualified for this task because, as daily practitioners of research software best practices, they have significant firsthand experience with modern software development tools and techniques.
Additionally, as members of the research community they posses the proper context by which to frame the training material.

INTERSECT will sponsor and organize workshops comprised of professional RSEs.
The purpose of these workshop is two fold. The first and primary objective is to collaboratively generate the training topics and content for the RSE Bootcamps (described next).
The second objective is to foster collaboration and nurture RSE peer relationships
