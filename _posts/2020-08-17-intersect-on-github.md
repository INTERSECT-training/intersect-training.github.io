We will be hosting the INTERSECT website using GitHub. It will live at [intersect-training.github.io](https://intersect-training.github.io). The GiHub organization can be found at [github.com/intersect-training](https://github.com/intersect-training).
Contributions to the website and project are welcome. Instructions for how to contribute to the website can be found in the README file in the website directory.

This open source approach is popular approach for research projects and personal websites/blogs.
We hope that by building this project's site using open-source options and hosting using a platform many are already familiar with (or will become familiar in the course of INTERSECT training) that others will be able to learn and adopt similar approaches for their projects.
