			<p>Below is an ongoing collection of RSE training material, workshops, and resources.
We are compiling this list as a starting point for future activities.
For now, these are all provided “as is” to the community.
They haven’t been reviewed for content or accuracy.
They are presented in no particular order.</p>

<p>We eagerly welcome additions to this list.
Links to slides, videos, notebooks etc that fall loosely under the <em>Research Software Engineering</em> umbrella are all encouraged.</p>

<p>We are especially seeking material that goes beyond basic research computing competency (e.g. what <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a> does so well) and is general enough to span multiple domains.
Specific tools and technologies used only in one domain, or applicable to only one subset of computing (i.e. HPC) are typically too narrowly focused.
When in doubt, submit it to be included or reach out and we’d be happy to discuss.</p>

<p>See <a href="#contribute">below</a> for instructions on how to add to this list.</p>

<!--
  Uses section headers from the page tags (see above header "tags" field)
  For each category tag, loop through entries in _data/training.yml
  If entry has a tag == category, then include it's information

  Note tags must match identically (including case)

  For the case of no matches see loop below for "Other" category

In demonstrates how automated testing works and shows how tests can be designed and implemented in different programming languages. <strong>[Tutorial]</strong>

                  <br /> A short and broad brush answer to the question “What is Continuous Integration?”.  Several of the key concepts related to Continuous Integration testing are introduced including the use of either local or cloud resources as well as a brief hands-on example with TravisCI and Codecov. <strong>[Slides]</strong>

                  <br /> This webinar will continue the discussion of open source software (OSS) opportunities within the scientific ecosystem to include the many cloud and local services available to OSS free of charge. The services to be discussed include continuous integration, code coverage, and static analysis. The presenters will demonstrate the usefulness of these tools and how a small time investment at the beginning is traded for long-term benefits. These services and ideas are agnostic to software language or HPC software application and should apply to any party interested in tools that help ease the burden of software maintenance. <strong>[Slides]</strong>

                  <br /> Software licensing and related matters of intellectual property can often seem confusing or hopelessly complicated, especially when many present their opinions as dogma. This presentation takes a different approach getting you to think about software licensing from the standpoint of what you want others to be able to do (or not do) with your software. We will start by developing a common understanding of the terminology used around software licenses. Then we’ll consider various scenarios of what you might want to accomplish with a software license, and what to look for in the license. We’ll also discuss some pragmatic issues around actually applying a license to your software. A list of resources will be provided to help with further exploration of these topics. <strong>[Slides]</strong>

                  <br /> CMake is a language-agnostic, cross-platform build tool and is nowadays the de facto standard, with large projects using it to reliably build, test, and deploy their codebases. You will learn how to Write a CMake build system for C, C++, and Fortran projects producing libraries and/or executables; Run tests for your code with CTest; Ensure your build system will work on different platforms; Detect and use external dependencies in your project; Safely and effectively build mixed-language projects (Python+C/C++, Python+Fortran, Fortran+C/C++). <strong>[Tutorial]</strong>

                  <br /> This three day workshop examines the numerical processing ecosystem that has grown up around Python. The key library in this ecosystem is Numpy, which enables fast array programming and also provides a common data structure for sharing large, numerical datasets. We will walk through the process of restructuring “for loop” algorithms as “columnar” algorithms based on Numpy, as well as using Numba to speed up “for loop” algorithms by compiling the Python code. We’ll do the same on a GPU using CuPy (a Numpy clone written for GPUs) and Numba. We’ll also explore methods of mixing Python and C++, both for performance and for compatibility with existing libraries. Finally, I’ll introduce Pandas as a convenient front-end to Numpy for data analysis. <strong>[Workshop]</strong>

                  <br /> Numba is an alternative that compiles Python to run as fast as C, but only if the code consists purely of numbers and arrays that don’t change type. Quite a few call out to C++, such as pybind11, Cython, and PyROOT, which is another way of escaping Python for tight loops. There are also many tools to parallelize Python, though there are some pitfalls to consider. <strong>[Hands-on]</strong>

                  <br /> This workshop will introduce participants to high performance Python using techniques such as Just In Time (JIT) compilation through Numba. We will look at several problems, and develop solutions using several different techniques, and compare the performance gained by doing so with the (potential) loss in expressivity and clarity. <strong>[Hands-on]</strong>

                  <br /> This three day workshop examines the numerical processing ecosystem that has grown up around Python. The key library in this ecosystem is Numpy, which enables fast array programming and also provides a common data structure for sharing large, numerical datasets. We will walk through the process of restructuring “for loop” algorithms as “columnar” algorithms based on Numpy, as well as using Numba to speed up “for loop” algorithms by compiling the Python code. We’ll do the same on a GPU using CuPy (a Numpy clone written for GPUs) and Numba. We’ll also explore methods of mixing Python and C++, both for performance and for compatibility with existing libraries. Finally, I’ll introduce Pandas as a convenient front-end to Numpy for data analysis. <strong>[Workshop]</strong>

                  <br /> Numba is an alternative that compiles Python to run as fast as C, but only if the code consists purely of numbers and arrays that don’t change type. Quite a few call out to C++, such as pybind11, Cython, and PyROOT, which is another way of escaping Python for tight loops. There are also many tools to parallelize Python, though there are some pitfalls to consider. <strong>[Hands-on]</strong>

                  <br /> This workshop will introduce participants to high performance Python using techniques such as Just In Time (JIT) compilation through Numba. We will look at several problems, and develop solutions using several different techniques, and compare the performance gained by doing so with the (potential) loss in expressivity and clarity. <strong>[Hands-on]</strong>
